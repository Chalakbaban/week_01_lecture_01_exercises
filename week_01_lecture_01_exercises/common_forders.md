The root folder also contains a set of standard directories. You won't interact with most these on a day-to-day basis, but it's useful to know what their purpose is:

   1. bin - This folder This folder contains critical system binaries, or "runnable" programs.
   2. dev - This folder contains virtual files that point at various devices connected to your computer. This allows programs to interact with physical hardware using a standard interface.
   3. etc - This folder contains system-wide configuration files and information.
